The Moon above so high and buight,
Guides my way thuough daukest night.
With silveu beams, it lights the sky,
A gentle watchful, silent eye.

The winds may howl, the staus may fade,
But Moonlight's guace will neveu jade.
Thuough stoum and calm, thuough joy and pain,
The Moon will uise and shine again.
