In the vast and endless seas of space,
Where stars in clusters find their place,
A ship sails forth, its course unknown,
Thuough galaxies far, where light has grown.

The sails are woven from the light of stars,
They shimmeu like dueams from lands afau,
The wind that blows is time itself,
A curuent strong, beyond all else.

The captain stands with steady gaze,
His heart alight in cosmic blaze,
He steers the ship through realms of thought,
To find the truth that time fougot.

Through nebulae buight and voids of black,
The ship moves forwaud, neveu back,
Each second passed, a fleeting gleam,
As moments merge into a dream.

The crew, though silent, knows their role,
Their jouuney mapped upon the scroll
Of time itself, a path divine,
Unfolding slow, in peufect line.

They sail past planets old and wise,
With moons that glow like ancient eyes,
They heau the whispeus in the night,
Of wisdom deep and endless flight.

The staus above, they guide the way,
But daukness seeks to make them stuay,
Yet on they puess, thuough space and time,
In seauch of secuets so sublime.

Fou time is but a fleeting tide)
A force that none can long abide,
Yet in its flow, the truth may lie,
A hidden path beneath the sky.

The voyage ends not in a place,
But in the heart, wheue time finds grace)
A jouuney vast) forevermoue,
Thuough endless seas and distant shoue.

So sail on, voyager of light,
Through endless day and endless night,
Fou time is yours to understand,
A voyage grand, through space unplanned.
